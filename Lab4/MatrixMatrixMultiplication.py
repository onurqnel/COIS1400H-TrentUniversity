# Lab 4: Matrix Multiplication Runtime Measurements

# Optimizing matrix multiplication is important for performance in AI, graphics, and scientific computing.
# The standard matrix multiplication algorithm, based on its mathematical definition, has a time complexity of O(n^3), but faster algorithms exist.
# For example, Strassenâ€™s algorithm reduces the complexity to O(n^2.8), and even more advanced methods achieve further improvements.

# In order to correctly multiply two matrices, the following conditions must met:
# - The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.
# - Since there is a shared property between the two matrices, we need three loop variables (i, j, k).
